# App Store Review Feedback - Guideline 2.1

## Review Issue

**Date:** 30/05/2025  
**Guideline:** 2.1 - Information Needed

### Problem Description

We were unable to sign in with the following demo account credentials you provided in App Store Connect:

**User name:** +11213141516  
**Password:** 123456

To avoid delays, it is essential to provide access to the app's full features and functionality with every submission.

### Next Steps Required by Apple

Provide the username and password for a valid demo account in App Store Connect that provides full access to the app's features and functionality or include a demonstration mode that shows all of the features and functionality available in the app. Note that we cannot use a demo video showing the app in use to continue the review.

---

## Solution Implemented

**Issue Root Cause:** Test account validity had expired

**Solution:** Fixed the test account validity by updating it in Supabase

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved

### Notes
- No code file edits were required
- Issue was resolved by updating account credentials in Supabase backend
- Test account is now valid and should allow Apple reviewers full access to app features

---

## Debug Logging Added

**Date:** 30/05/2025  
**Issue:** Verify button not working on OTP verification screen

### Debugging Changes Made

Added comprehensive logging to track the OTP verification flow:

1. **OTP Verification Page** (`lib/app/platforms/mobile/auth/presentation/pages/otp_verification.dart`)
   - Added logs when verify button is tapped
   - Logs OTP value, length, verification type, and callback function

2. **Auth Bloc** (`lib/app/platforms/mobile/auth/presentation/bloc/auth_bloc/bloc.dart`)
   - Added logs when OnVerifyEvent is received
   - Logs OTP validation, phone number, and verification flow
   - Added logs for insufficient OTP length
   - Enhanced error logging with stack traces

3. **Auth Controller** (`lib/app/shared/core/backend_controller/auth_controller/auth_controller_impl.dart`)
   - Added logs for Supabase API calls
   - Logs OTP, phone number, and API response
   - Enhanced error logging for API failures

### Log Identifiers
- üî• `[OTP_VERIFICATION]` - UI level logs
- üöÄ `[AUTH_BLOC]` - Business logic logs  
- üì± `[AUTH_CONTROLLER]` - API level logs

### Usage
Check console/debug logs when testing OTP verification to identify where the flow is failing.

---

## Issue Resolution

**Date:** 30/05/2025  
**Issue:** OTP verification successful but no navigation happening

### Root Cause Found
Through the comprehensive logging, we identified that:
1. ‚úÖ OTP verification with Supabase was successful (User ID: 276fba41-a6c7-48b6-a872-5048c8f64566)
2. ‚ùå User lookup in app database returned `null` for phone number `9192939495`
3. ‚ùå No navigation logic for new users who authenticate but don't exist in app database

### Solution Implemented
Added `_handleNewUser()` method to completely delete orphaned Supabase users:
- **Completely deletes user from Supabase database** when they exist in Supabase but not in app database
- **Navigates back to auth page** to start completely fresh signup process
- **Prevents orphaned authentication states** where user is authenticated but has no app profile
- **Ensures fresh database entry** for users who need to be properly registered

### Code Changes
- Added `deleteUser()` method in AuthController interface and implementation
- Added `_handleNewUser()` method in AuthPageBloc that calls `auth.deleteUser()`
- Modified user lookup logic to handle null results by completely removing user from database
- Added navigation back to auth page for fresh signup process
- Added comprehensive error handling with fallback to signOut if delete fails

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - OTP verification now handles orphaned Supabase users properly

### Final Implementation Notes
- **Updated to use same RPC logic as profile delete account feature**
- Uses `supabase.rpc('delete_user_account', params: {'p_user_id': currentUser.id})`
- Same proven method used in settings screen for account deletion
- Fallback to `signOut()` if RPC fails
- User session is cleared and they're navigated back for fresh signup
- No more orphaned authentication states
- Clean signup flow enforced for users not in app database
- **Implementation matches existing codebase patterns**

## Privacy Purpose Strings Issue

**Date:** 30/05/2025  
**Guideline:** 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage

### Problem Description

One or more purpose strings in the app do not sufficiently explain the use of protected resources. Purpose strings must clearly and completely describe the app's use of data and, in most cases, provide an example of how the data will be used.

**Apple's Feedback:** Update the location purpose string to explain how the app will use the requested information and provide a specific example of how the data will be used.

### Solution Implemented

Updated all location permission strings in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to be more specific and detailed:

#### Updated Permission Strings:

1. **NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription:**
   - Added specific numbered examples: (1) Show nearby stores with offers, (2) Display location-specific content, (3) Find local agents, (4) Set country/region
   - Clarified data processing is local and never shared

2. **NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription:**
   - Added background usage examples: (1) Nearby stores, (2) Location-based notifications, (3) Location-specific content, (4) Local agents, (5) Country/region settings
   - Explained both foreground and background usage

3. **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription:**
   - Added background-specific examples: (1) Location-based notifications, (2) Location-specific content, (3) Local agents, (4) Country/region updates
   - Clarified background usage scenarios

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Specific numbered examples** instead of generic descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Clear use cases** for each location permission type
- ‚úÖ **Privacy assurance** - data processed locally, never shared
- ‚úÖ **Detailed explanations** of how location enhances user experience

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Location permission strings now meet Apple's specificity requirements

## App Tracking Transparency Issue

**Date:** 30/05/2025  
**Guideline:** 5.1.2 - Legal - Privacy - Data Use and Sharing

### Problem Description

The app privacy information provided in App Store Connect indicates the app collects data in order to track the user, including Email Address and Name. However, the app does not use App Tracking Transparency to request the user's permission before tracking their activity.

**Apple's Feedback:** Apps need to receive the user's permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework before collecting data used to track them. This requirement protects the privacy of users.

### Solution Implemented

Added App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission request to the splash screen to ensure Apple reviewers see it early in the app flow:

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Added ATT Request to Splash Screen:**
   - Modified `lib/app/platforms/mobile/splash/presentation/pages/splash.dart`
   - Added `_requestTrackingPermissionIfNeeded()` method
   - Triggers early in app lifecycle during splash screen

2. **Smart Permission Logic:**
   - Checks current tracking status first
   - Only shows dialog if status is `notDetermined`
   - Prevents duplicate permission requests

3. **Existing Infrastructure Used:**
   - Leveraged existing `TrackingService` class
   - Used existing `TrackingPermissionDialog` widget
   - iOS native implementation already in place in `AppDelegate.swift`

4. **Comprehensive Logging:**
   - Added tracking logs with üîí [TRACKING] prefix
   - Tracks permission status and user responses
   - Helps debug permission flow

#### Files Modified:

- `lib/app/platforms/mobile/splash/presentation/pages/splash.dart` - Added ATT request
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Already had ATT implementation
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Already had NSUserTrackingUsageDescription
- `lib/services/tracking_service.dart` - Already existed
- `lib/widgets/tracking_permission_dialog.dart` - Already existed

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Early permission request** - Shows during splash screen
- ‚úÖ **Apple compliance** - Uses AppTrackingTransparency framework
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly dialog** - Custom explanation before system prompt
- ‚úÖ **Smart logic** - Only shows when needed
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** - Easy to debug and verify

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - App Tracking Transparency now properly implemented and visible to Apple reviewers

## Background Location Mode Issue

**Date:** 30/05/2025  
**Guideline:** 2.5.4 - Performance - Software Requirements

### Problem Description

The app declares support for location in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist file but we are unable to locate any features that require persistent location. Apps that declare support for location in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist file must have features that require persistent location.

**Apple's Feedback:** If the app does not require persistent real-time location updates, please remove the "location" setting from the UIBackgroundModes key.

### Solution Implemented

Removed background location mode from UIBackgroundModes since the app only uses location for personalized services when in use, not persistent background tracking:

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Background Location Mode:**
   - Removed `<string>location</string>` from UIBackgroundModes array
   - Updated comment to reflect location removal
   - Kept other background modes: fetch, processing, remote-notification

2. **Updated Location Permission Strings:**
   - Modified NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription to remove background references
   - Updated NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription to remove background-specific language
   - Kept NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription as-is (appropriate for foreground use)

3. **Clarified Location Usage:**
   - Location only used for personalized services when app is active
   - No persistent background location tracking
   - Location used for: nearby stores, content recommendations, local agents, country/region settings

#### Technical Details:

**Before:**
```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>processing</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
    <string>location</string>  <!-- REMOVED -->
</array>
```

**After:**
```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>fetch</string>
    <string>processing</string>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Compliance with Apple guidelines** - No background location mode without persistent features
- ‚úÖ **Accurate permission descriptions** - Strings match actual app behavior
- ‚úÖ **Clear location usage** - Only for personalized services when app is in use
- ‚úÖ **Privacy focused** - No unnecessary background location access

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Background location mode removed, app now complies with Apple's software requirements

**Apple's Feedback:** If the app integrates the functionality referenced above, indicate where in the app we can locate it. If the app does not include this functionality, indicate this information in the Review Notes section for each version of the app in App Store Connect when submitting for review.

### Solution Implemented

Removed Apple Pay integration while keeping Google Pay functionality:

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Apple Pay Configuration:**
   - Removed `defaultApplePay` configuration from `payment_config.dart`
   - Kept only Google Pay configuration

2. **Updated Payment Methods:**
   - Removed Apple Pay option from payment methods list
   - Kept Google Pay option for users who want it

## iOS App Crash Issue - Geofencing Service

**Date:** 31/05/2025  
**Issue:** Critical iOS app freezing/crashing due to geofencing service

### Problem Description

The iOS app was experiencing crashes and freezing issues caused by the `geofence_foreground_service` plugin attempting to set background location updates without proper authorization. The error was:

```
"Invalid parameter not satisfying: !stayUp || CLClientIsBackgroundable(internal->fClient) || _CFMZEnabled()"
```

This was causing the app to become unresponsive and crash on iOS devices.

### Root Cause

1. **Improper Background Location Authorization:** The geofencing plugin was trying to enable `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true` without checking if the app had proper authorization
2. **Missing Platform Checks:** No conditional logic to handle iOS-specific limitations
3. **Plugin Compatibility:** The `geofence_foreground_service` plugin had iOS-specific issues with background location handling

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **iOS Info.plist Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Added `location` to `UIBackgroundModes` array for proper background location support
- ‚úÖ Enhanced location permission strings with detailed explanations

#### 2. **Platform-Specific Geofencing Logic:**
- ‚úÖ Modified `GeofenceService` class to safely disable geofencing on iOS
- ‚úÖ Added `Platform.isIOS` checks in all geofencing methods:
  - `initialize()` - Returns success without starting service on iOS
  - `addGeofence()` - Skips geofence creation on iOS
  - `removeGeofence()` - Skips geofence removal on iOS
  - `removeAllGeoFences()` - Skips bulk removal on iOS
  - `stopService()` - Skips service stopping on iOS

#### 3. **Error Handling & Logging:**
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around geofencing operations
- ‚úÖ Added detailed logging for debugging geofencing issues
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback behavior when geofencing fails

#### 4. **Preserved Android Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Full geofencing functionality continues to work on Android
- ‚úÖ No impact on Android user experience
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific behavior ensures optimal performance

### Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/app/shared/core/utils/geofence_service.dart` - Added iOS conditional logic
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Added location background mode
- `ios/Classes/GeofenceForegroundServicePlugin.swift` - Created fixed plugin version

**Key Code Changes:**
```dart
// Skip geofencing initialization on iOS to prevent crashes
if (Platform.isIOS) {
  log('Geofencing service disabled on iOS');
  return true; // Return true to not break the app flow
}
```

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **iOS Stability:** App no longer crashes or freezes on iOS
- ‚úÖ **Platform Optimization:** Different behavior for iOS vs Android
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Degradation:** Core app functionality preserved on both platforms
- ‚úÖ **Error Prevention:** Comprehensive error handling prevents future crashes
- ‚úÖ **Debugging Support:** Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

### Result

- **iOS:** Geofencing safely disabled, app runs smoothly, all core features work
- **Android:** Full geofencing functionality preserved, no changes to user experience
- **Overall:** App stability improved across both platforms

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - iOS app crash issue completely resolved

## Stripe/PassKit Framework Complete Removal

**Date:** 11/06/2025  
**Guideline:** 2.1 - Information Needed

### Problem Description

Apple detected PassKit framework in the app binary but could not find any Apple Pay implementation. This was caused by the `flutter_stripe` package automatically including the StripeApplePay framework, which contains PassKit references, even though we only used Stripe for card payments and not Apple Pay.

**Apple's Feedback:** The app binary includes the PassKit framework for implementing Apple Pay, but we were unable to verify any integration of Apple Pay within the app.

### Solution Implemented

Completely removed all Stripe dependencies and functionality to eliminate PassKit framework inclusion:

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Stripe Dependencies:**
   - Removed `flutter_stripe` and `flutter_stripe_web` packages from `pubspec.yaml`
   - Kept `pay` package for Google Pay functionality only

2. **Removed Stripe Code:**
   - Removed Stripe import and initialization from `app.dart`
   - Removed Stripe payment logic from `payment_methods.dart`
   - Removed Stripe secret keys from `constants.dart`
   - Removed `stripeCreatePaymentIntent` method from agent card wallet bloc

3. **Updated Payment Options:**
   - Disabled card payment option (shows fallback message)
   - Preserved Google Pay, UPI, Razorpay, and Hushh Coins functionality
   - Users can still make payments through alternative methods

4. **Cleaned iOS Dependencies:**
   - Ran `flutter clean` to remove all build artifacts
   - Regenerated iOS dependencies without Stripe frameworks
   - Eliminated PassKit framework references completely

#### Technical Details:

**Removed Dependencies:**
```yaml
# REMOVED from pubspec.yaml
flutter_stripe:
flutter_stripe_web:
```

**Removed Code:**
- `import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';`
- `Stripe.publishableKey` initialization
- Stripe payment sheet implementation
- Stripe API calls and secret keys

**Preserved Functionality:**
- Google Pay using `pay` package
- UPI payments
- Razorpay integration
- Hushh Coins system

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **No PassKit framework** - Completely eliminated from app binary
- ‚úÖ **No Apple Pay references** - All Stripe/Apple Pay code removed
- ‚úÖ **Alternative payments preserved** - Users can still make payments
- ‚úÖ **Clean codebase** - No unused payment frameworks
- ‚úÖ **Apple compliance** - No PassKit without Apple Pay implementation

### Impact on Users

## Login Services Compliance Issue

**Date:** 11/06/2025  
**Guideline:** 4.8 - Design - Login Services

### Problem Description

Apple requires that apps using third-party login services (like Google Sign-In) must offer an equivalent login option that meets all of the following requirements:

1. **Limited data collection** - Only user's name and email address
2. **Email privacy option** - Users can keep email private from all parties
3. **No advertising data collection** - Without explicit user consent

**Apple's Feedback:** The app uses Google Sign-In but does not appear to offer an equivalent login option that meets all the above requirements.

### Solution Implemented

Enabled Apple Sign-In as the compliant login option while maintaining user preferences:

#### Changes Made:

1. **Re-enabled Apple Sign-In:**
   - Uncommented Apple Sign-In integration for iOS devices
   - Added Apple Sign-In as second option (after phone, before Google)
   - Apple Sign-In automatically meets all Guideline 4.8 requirements

2. **Strategic Login Order:**
   - **Primary:** Phone/OTP login (customer preference - 98% prefer this)
   - **Secondary:** Apple Sign-In (Apple compliance requirement)
   - **Tertiary:** Google Sign-In (existing functionality)

3. **Privacy Compliance:**
   - Phone/OTP: Minimal data collection (phone number only)
   - Apple Sign-In: Built-in privacy features (hide email, limited data)
   - Google Sign-In: Available but not primary option

#### Technical Implementation:

**Login Options Order:**
```dart
List<LoginMode> socialMethods = [
  LoginMode.phone,    // Primary - customer preference
  LoginMode.apple,    // iOS only - Apple compliance  
  LoginMode.google,   // Secondary option
];
```

**Platform-Specific Logic:**
- **iOS:** Shows Phone ‚Üí Apple Sign-In ‚Üí Google Sign-In
- **Android:** Shows Phone ‚Üí Google Sign-In (no Apple Sign-In needed)

### Key Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Apple Compliance:** Apple Sign-In meets all Guideline 4.8 requirements
- ‚úÖ **Customer Preference:** Phone/OTP remains primary option (98% customer preference)
- ‚úÖ **Privacy First:** Minimal data collection with phone/OTP login
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Options:** Multiple login methods for user choice
- ‚úÖ **Platform Optimized:** Different options for iOS vs Android

### User Experience Impact

- **Existing Users:** No change - can continue using phone/OTP or Google
- **New iOS Users:** See Apple Sign-In option for enhanced privacy
- **Privacy-Conscious Users:** Can choose Apple Sign-In for maximum privacy
- **Survey Results:** 98% customers prefer phone/OTP (still primary option)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Apple Sign-In enabled for Guideline 4.8 compliance while preserving customer preferences

## Apple Sign-In Email/Name Collection Issue

**Date:** 31/05/2025  
**Guideline:** 4.0 - Design

### Problem Description
Apple reported that the app requires users to provide their name and/or email address after using Sign in with Apple, even though this information is already provided by the Authentication Services framework. This violates Apple's design and user experience requirements.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Testing revealed:**
- **First-time Apple Sign-In:** Apple provides email and name ‚úÖ
- **Subsequent Apple Sign-In:** Apple only provides user identifier, NOT email/name ‚ùå
- **"Hide My Email" users:** Apple provides relay email first time, then nothing ‚ùå

**Developer testing confirmed:**
```
üçé [APPLE_SIGN_IN] Email: (none)
üçé [APPLE_SIGN_IN] Name: (none) (none)
```

### Solution Implemented

**1. Auto-fill from Apple Credentials:**
- When Apple provides email/name, automatically store in `TempUserModel`
- Pre-fill sign-up form fields with Apple-provided data
- Skip asking for information already provided by Apple

**2. Smart Fallback for Missing Data:**
- When Apple doesn't provide email (subsequent logins, "Hide My Email"), show Apple-style dialog
- Dialog matches Apple's design guidelines (icon, typography, colors)
- Only collect missing information, never duplicate Apple-provided data

**3. Code Implementation:**
```dart
// Store Apple credentials immediately after sign-in
final tempUser = TempUserModel(
  avatar: null,
  name: fullName,  // From Apple credential
  countryCode: null,
  phoneNumber: null,
  email: credential.email,  // From Apple credential
);
AppLocalStorage.updateTempUser(tempUser);

// Pre-fill sign-up form with Apple data
if (tempUser?.name != null && tempUser!.name!.isNotEmpty) {
  firstNameController.text = nameParts.first;
  lastNameController.text = nameParts.sublist(1).join(' ');
}
if (tempUser?.email != null && tempUser!.email!.isNotEmpty) {
  emailOrPhoneController.text = tempUser.email!;
}
```

**4. User Experience Flow:**
- **Scenario A:** Apple provides email/name ‚Üí Auto-fill form ‚Üí No user input needed
- **Scenario B:** Apple hides email ‚Üí Show dialog ‚Üí Collect only missing email
- **Scenario C:** Apple provides nothing ‚Üí Show dialog ‚Üí Collect required info

### Apple Design Compliance
‚úÖ **No duplicate data collection** - Never ask for info Apple already provided  
‚úÖ **Apple-style dialog** - Matches native iOS design when fallback needed  
‚úÖ **Respects user choice** - Honors "Hide My Email" preference  
‚úÖ **Seamless experience** - Users don't notice the technical complexity  

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed ‚Äì Apple Sign-In now fully complies with Apple's design guidelines and user experience requirements.

**Verification:**
- Developer testing confirmed Apple provides no email/name on subsequent logins
- App correctly auto-fills when Apple provides data
- App shows Apple-style dialog only when data is missing
- No duplicate data collection from users
